## Executive Summary
The Department of Transportation (DOTr) stands on the precipice of effecting change that will redefine its policymaking capabilities. A look into the Project Management Office (PMO) of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) shed light on the nascent data practices within the Department and the gaps that a good data strategy can address, if properly implemented. This paper centers on a three-pronged data strategy encompassing aspects of people and culture, process improvements, and technological investments. 

A diagnostic survey was conducted to align the organization's data strategy with its objectives and identify the key priorities and areas for collaboration within the PUVMP PMO. An in-depth interview then ensued to obtain granular insights into the existing data-driven initiatives, organizational objectives, and the roles of internal and external stakeholders. This elaborated the technological capabilities, overall sentiment towards data science and analytics, ongoing and planned data initiatives, business cases, and organizational structure.

A Data Science Maturity Model was then designed and utilized to comprehensively evaluate the PUVMP PMO's data capabilities. This model, drawing from established frameworks, assessed technical and organizational aspects, cultural acceptance, conceptual knowledge, and strategic planning. The PMO obtained a *'Foundational'* rating (2.74) in the model, indicative of its existing foundation for data-driven initiatives. The key findings revealed strengths in organizational structure and cultural acceptance, but identified necessary improvements in data infrastructure, data management, data governance, data analytics, and strategic planning.

Guided by three-faceted data strategy, optimizing processes, fostering a data-centric culture, and maximizing the right technology has the potential bring forth better policy decisions and operational efficiencies within the Department of Transportation.
